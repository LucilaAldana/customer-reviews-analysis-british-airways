# British Airways Customer Reviews Analysis

## by Lucila Aldana Quiñonez | Marketing Data Analyst

This project develops an interactive Tableau dashboard combined with Python-based sentiment and keyword analysis to evaluate customer reviews for British Airways between 2016 and 2023.

The objective was to identify the key drivers of customer recommendation, understand value-for-money perception, and detect service quality gaps across cabin class, traveler type, route, and region.

The dashboard analyzes:

• Overall rating distribution (1–10 scale)

• Recommendation rate (recommended vs. not recommended)

• Satisfaction by service dimension:

    ○ Cabin Staff Service

    ○ Seat Comfort

    ○ Food & Beverages

    ○ Entertainment

    ○ Ground Service

    ○ Value for Money

• Performance by cabin class, traveler type, aircraft, continent, and year

• Sentiment classification (Positive / Neutral / Negative)

• Keyword-based aspect analysis for non-recommending reviews

Key insights supported by the analysis include:

• Overall polarized perception, with 55% of ratings at 3 or below

• Decline in overall rating trend in recent years

• Entertainment as the most inconsistent and lowest-rated service dimension

• Limited variation across traveler type and cabin class, indicating systemic service patterns rather than isolated segment issues

• Strong alignment between textual sentiment and recommendation behavior

• Operational friction (boarding, lounge experience, time-related issues) as recurring dissatisfaction triggers

The project integrates structured rating analysis with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract actionable insights from unstructured written reviews, providing a more complete view of customer perception beyond numeric scores alone.

Data limitations such as uneven yearly review volume and absence of reliable unique customer identifiers are documented to ensure realistic interpretation of trends.

This analysis simulates a real-world airline customer experience evaluation scenario where quantitative KPIs and qualitative feedback are combined to guide service investment priorities and brand positioning decisions.
